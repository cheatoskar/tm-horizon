---
A plugin is a native 32-bit DLL that Horizon Client loads into a TrackMania game. The host owns the Direct3D hook, the Dear ImGui context, input, hotkeys and the game hooks. My plugin only gets what it needs through one table of functions (`HorizonHostApi`).

The contract is `include/horizon_plugin.h` (C, MIT) and `include/horizon_imgui.h` (C++ helper). Two examples live in `plugins/`: `sample` (small, commented) and `eswc-autosave` (real, with game calls).

## Folder layout

```
horizon\plugins\<id>\
    <id>.dll        the plugin (name set by "dll" in plugin.json)
    plugin.json     what the launcher and the host read before loading the DLL
```

`<id>` is lowercase `[a-z0-9-]` and must equal the `id` in `plugin.json` and in `HorizonPlugin_Info`.

## plugin.json

```json
{
  "id": "eswc-autosave",
  "name": "ESWC Autosave",
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "dll": "eswc-autosave.dll",
  "games": ["eswc"],
  "online": "online-ok",
  "abi": 1,
  "description": "Saves your replay after each finish, without the dialogs.",
  "author": "cheatoskar"
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `id` | Folder and settings id. |
| `name`, `description`, `author` | Shown in the menu. Keep the description to one short sentence. |
| `version` | Semver. |
| `dll` | File name of the DLL. Default `<id>.dll`. |
| `games` | Any of `"eswc"`, `"sunrise"`, `"original"`, `"tmnf"`, `"tmuf"`. |
| `online` | `"solo-only"` or `"online-ok"`, see Online gate. |
| `abi` | `HORIZON_ABI` the plugin was built against (1 today). |
| `enabled_by_default` | `false`: off until switched on in the menu when there is no profile.json (default `true`). |
| `icon` | PNG file name in the plugin's folder, e.g. `"icon.png"` (no sub-folders, no `..`). Square, 64-256 px, transparent corners welcome; shown as a rounded square in the menu and the bar. Missing or unreadable: coloured initials. |

The same facts are repeated inside the DLL (`HorizonPlugin_Info`). The JSON lets the launcher show the plugin without loading it. If they disagree, the DLL wins.

## Exports and lifecycle

All exports are `__cdecl`, undecorated names.

| Export | Required | When |
|---|---|---|
| `HorizonPlugin_Info` | yes | Before anything else. Returns a static `HorizonPluginInfo` (abi, id, name, version, games, caps, flags, author, description, abi_minor). |
| `HorizonPlugin_Init(host)` | yes | Once, if abi and game match. Return 0 to load. Any other number shows the plugin as Failed with that number (I use 2 for "wrong exe"). |
| `HorizonPlugin_Shutdown` | yes | Before the DLL is unloaded. Stop threads, free memory. `host` is invalid afterwards. |
| `HorizonPlugin_DrawMenu` | with `CAP_MENU` | Every frame the plugin's page is visible, inside an ImGui child. |
| `HorizonPlugin_DrawOverlay` | with `CAP_OVERLAY` | Every frame while the plugin is enabled and not gated. |
| `HorizonPlugin_OnEvent(const HorizonEvent*)` | with `CAP_GAME_EVENTS` | Per subscribed event. |
| `HorizonPlugin_SetEnabled(int)` | with `FLAG_LIVE_TOGGLE` | User switches the plugin on or off without a restart. |

Capabilities (`HORIZON_CAP_*`): MENU, OVERLAY, DEVICE, GAME_EVENTS, GAME_CONTROL. Flags: exactly one of `SOLO_ONLY` / `ONLINE_OK`, plus optionally `LIVE_TOGGLE`.

Define `HORIZON_PLUGIN_BUILD` before including the header, so the exports get `dllexport`.

## Threading

Every call into my plugin, and every call of mine into the host, happens on the game's main thread. Events are delivered synchronously inside the game's own call, so handlers must be short. Calling game code from a handler is allowed if I know it is safe at that point (the autosave plugin does).

The only function that is safe from any thread is `run_on_game_thread(plugin, callback, user)`. It queues the callback for the end of a frame. A worker thread must not call `log`, `set_*`, `post_replay_saved` or anything else directly. In `Shutdown` I wait for my own threads.

## Events

Subscribe with `host->subscribe(plugin, HORIZON_EVENT_BIT(HORIZON_EVENT_FINISH) | ...)`. Without a subscription `OnEvent` is never called. Check `e->size` before reading fields a newer host may have added.

| Event | Fields |
|---|---|
| `MAP_LOADED` | `map` (path, uid, name, author, environment, medal times) |
| `RACE_START` | |
| `RESPAWN` | `respawns` |
| `CHECKPOINT` | `time_ms`, `checkpoint_index` |
| `FINISH` | `time_ms`, `is_local_player`, `respawns`, `play_mode`, `is_pb` |
| `RACE_END` | `end_screen`, `engine_replay` |
| `MENU_ENTERED` | |
| `REPLAY_SAVED` | `path`, `source` ("game" or the plugin id) |
| `ONLINE_CHANGED` | `is_online` (sent to every plugin, gated or not) |
| `GAME_STATE` | `game_state` |

Which game delivers what, and how (`poll` = read once a frame from the game's objects, nothing hooked; `hook` = inline hook with the prologue checked byte for byte):

| Event | ESWC | Sunrise (first test) | Forever (TMNF/TMUF) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MAP_LOADED` | poll | poll | poll (uid/author/path only for maps gamectl started; times from the challenge) |
| `RACE_START` | poll (start counter) | hook (`OnStartLine`) | poll (RaceState to 1, also each restart) |
| `RESPAWN` | poll (respawn counter) | no | no |
| `CHECKPOINT` | poll (checkpoint counter) | hook (`OnCheckpoint`) | no |
| `FINISH` | hook (`OnFinishLine`) | hook (`OnFinishLine`) | poll (RaceState 1 to 2, time read once) |
| `RACE_END` | hook (replay stop, solo race end) | hook (solo race end, no replay pointer) | no (no reliable signal; the end screen is the `END_RACE` game state) |
| `MENU_ENTERED`, `GAME_STATE`, `ONLINE_CHANGED` | poll | poll | poll |
| `REPLAY_SAVED` | yes | no | no |

Forever never hooks, writes game memory or touches input, because Competition Patch 2.0 may treat changed code bytes as tampering. Everything above is read through reflection member names with every read SEH-guarded. Game states there: `SOLO_RACE` while driving, `END_RACE` once RaceState is finished, `NET_RACE` (online), `EDITOR`, `REPLAY` (replay editor or another race class), `LOADING` (map set, no race yet), `MAIN_MENU`. Replay and editor give no run events. The editor/replay split and the finish time on the end screen are unverified in game (first test).

Notes for ESWC:

- `FINISH` comes right after `CTrackManiaRace::OnFinishLine` returned. `is_pb` is true if the local best changed or the time was below the best before.
- `RACE_END` comes in two forms. After `StopReplayRecordAndKeepCopy`, when the previous-race replay changed: `end_screen = 0`, `play_mode` NET, `engine_replay` is the new copy. After the solo race-end function: `end_screen = 1`, `play_mode` SOLO, `engine_replay` is the current replay. If it happens inside `OnFinishLine`, the host still delivers it after `FINISH`.
- So "save after a finish" is: remember `FINISH`, act on the next `RACE_END`. A `RACE_END` without a pending finish means nothing. `RACE_START` and `MAP_LOADED` clear a pending finish.
- `engine_race`, `engine_replay`, `engine_challenge` are raw game pointers. They only make sense to a plugin that carries address tables for that exact exe. Verify `game_info()->exe_sha256` first.

Times are milliseconds, `-1` = unknown. Strings may be `""` when the host cannot read them yet.

## Settings and data folder

- `get_int/set_int/get_float/set_float/get_string/set_string(plugin, key, ...)`: stored by the host in `horizon\settings\<id>.json`, written on change. Defaults are the `fallback` argument, so there is nothing to register.
- `data_folder(plugin)` / `data_folder_w(plugin)`: `horizon\data\<id>\` with a trailing backslash, already created. Use it for caches and history, never the game folder.
- `log(plugin, HORIZON_LOG_INFO, "fmt", ...)`: one line in the host log, prefixed with the id. Plain printf formats, UTF-8.

## Hotkeys

```cpp
int32_t h = host->register_hotkey(host->plugin, "save", "Save replay now", "F9", onSave, nullptr);
const char* shown = host->hotkey_text(host->plugin, h); // key now bound, "" = none
```

`action` is a stable id, `name` is shown in the menu, the key text is `"F9"`, `"Ctrl+Tab"`, `"Shift+F11"`, `"Insert"`, or `""` for no default. The user can rebind it and the host shows conflicts. The callback runs on the game thread once per press, not while the menu captures text, not while the plugin is off or gated online.

## Dear ImGui

The host and every plugin that draws must use the same Dear ImGui, 1.91.5 (`HORIZON_IMGUI_VERSION_NUM` 19150) with the default `imconfig.h`. With the static runtime (`/MT`) each DLL has its own heap and its own "current context", so in `Init` I call:

```cpp
#include "imgui.h"
#include "horizon_imgui.h"
bool ok = horizon_imgui_attach(host); // version check, host allocator, host context
```

The allocator matters: memory ImGui allocates inside my DLL is freed by the host and the other way round. Without the host's allocator that crashes. If attach returns false I log it and still work without a page (return early in `DrawMenu`). `host->style()` gives the TM Horizon colours and fonts (fonts are NULL until the first frame has been drawn).

Draw in `DrawMenu` with normal widgets. For an overlay I use `ImGui::GetForegroundDrawList()` or my own borderless window.

### Icons

The host merges a subset of the Lucide icons (ISC licence) into all its fonts, so a plugin can draw them with any font, including the default one. `horizon_imgui.h` has `HZ_ICON_<NAME>` (codepoint) and `HZ_ICON_<NAME>_U8` (UTF-8 string) for each icon, for example `ImGui::Text(HZ_ICON_SETTINGS_U8 " Settings");`. The codepoints are Lucide's own and ABI: they never change, new icons are only added. A plugin cannot add icons or fonts to the shared atlas itself. If the host has no icon font (resource missing), the icons show as `?`.

## Online gate

`online` in `plugin.json` and the flag in `Info` say what the plugin may do online:

- `solo-only` (`FLAG_SOLO_ONLY`, the default if nothing is set): while the game is online (LAN or internet race, server browser) the host stops its events, overlay, hotkeys and queued calls. `ONLINE_CHANGED` still arrives. `actions_allowed(plugin)` tells me if I may act now.
- `online-ok` (`FLAG_ONLINE_OK`): allowed online, but the TMX rules still apply, because TrackMania Exchange rejects tools that give an edge or that rewrite results.

The TMX rules for every plugin, online or not:

- no checkpoint or trigger display, no ideal line or brake line,
- nothing that changes physics, timing, input or replays of a run (saving a replay file after the fact is fine, editing the run is not),
- no disabling of camera or MediaTracker behaviour.

## Competition Patch (Forever)

Competition Patch is a mod for TMNF/TMUF that makes runs comparable. While it is loaded:

- my plugin never touches timing, physics, input or replay data,
- reflection writes are off while CP is loaded and a run is going; Horizon Scripts does not load scripts with the `game-control` permission while CP is loaded (read-only scripts keep running, see `docs/scripting.md`),
- `actions_allowed(plugin)` returns 0 during such a run and `HORIZON_ERR_BLOCKED_ONLINE` comes back from game control calls.

I do not work around this. Read-only plugins (overlays, loggers) are fine.

## Device access (renderers)

A plugin that renders itself (shaders, post effects) sets `HORIZON_CAP_DEVICE` and calls `set_device_callbacks` with a `HorizonDeviceCallbacks` table: `device_created`, `adjust_present_params`, `before_reset`, `after_reset`, `pre_present`. `host->device()` returns the `IDirect3DDevice9*` (NULL before creation). Per frame the order is: device plugins' `pre_present`, then the host's ImGui (menu and overlays), then `Present`. I never hook `Present`, `EndScene`, `Reset` or DirectInput myself.

## Other host functions

| Function | Use |
|---|---|
| `game_info()` | game bit, exe sha256, exe base (rebase link addresses: `base - 0x400000 + link`), folders, host version |
| `engine_pointer(HORIZON_ENGINE_APP / RACE / CHALLENGE)` | raw game objects, NULL if unknown |
| `post_replay_saved(plugin, utf8 path)` | tell everyone I wrote a replay file |
| `play_map_file`, `return_to_menu` | game control (`CAP_GAME_CONTROL`); return a `HorizonResult` |
| `get_game_state`, `is_online`, `menu_open` | current state |
| `request_restart_note(plugin, why)` | "applies after restart" note in the menu |
| `reflect_offset`, `reflect_method` | read-only engine reflection by class and member name |
| `create_texture_rgba`, `release_texture` (ABI 1.1) | an ImGui texture from RGBA8 pixels (map thumbnails), game thread; release it before Shutdown returns |
| `save_replay(plugin, name)` (ABI 1.1) | saves the run's replay like the game's "Save replay", without dialogs. ESWC (host 0.2.0): on the solo end-race screen the current run, elsewhere (menus, LAN/online after a race) the previous race's copy; `name` without extension, `""` = the game's default `<map>(mm'ss''cc)`; never overwrites (`name (2)` ...); sends `REPLAY_SAVED`. `HORIZON_ERR_WRONG_STATE` while a solo race runs or nothing is there to save, `HORIZON_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` on Sunrise and Forever. Game thread. |
| `register_panel`, `unregister_panel`, `panel_visible` (ABI 1.2) | see Panels |
| `set_host_flag(plugin, flag, on)`, `host_flags()` (ABI 1.2) | `HORIZON_HOST_FLAG_CAPTURE`: a photo or video is being taken; the bar and windows with "Hide in photos and videos" disappear. Each plugin sets its own bits; `host_flags()` is the OR. |
| `notify(plugin, &toast)` (ABI 1.3) | a toast in the corner of the screen, see Notifications and the TM Horizon bridge |
| `bridge_request(...)`, `bridge_state()` (ABI 1.3) | ask the TM Horizon launcher on the same PC (TMX search, map files, record replays), see Notifications and the TM Horizon bridge |
| `device()` | the game's `IDirect3DDevice9*` for every plugin (callbacks only with `CAP_DEVICE`) |

ABI 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 functions sit at the end of `HorizonHostApi`. A plugin built against 1.0 never sees them; one built against a newer minor checks `host->abi_minor` (>= 1, >= 2 or >= 3) before calling them.

## Panels (ABI 1.2)

A panel is a piece of a plugin's UI that the host places. Register it once (Init is fine):

```c
HorizonPanelDef d = {0};
d.size = sizeof(d);
d.key = "events";            /* [a-z0-9-], stable: the saved layout uses plugin id + key */
d.title = "Events";          /* tab and window title, one or two words */
d.icon = HZ_ICON_SCROLL_TEXT; /* horizon_imgui.h, 0 = none */
d.flags = HORIZON_PANEL_MENU_PAGE; /* or HORIZON_PANEL_HUD */
d.draw = drawEvents;         /* void draw(void* user): the body only, no Begin/End, no heading */
d.default_x = 0.05f; d.default_y = 0.2f; d.default_w = 0.22f; d.default_h = 0.3f; /* fractions; w/h 0 = fit */
host->register_panel(host->plugin, &d);
```

- Every panel is a tab on the plugin's page in the menu, after "Settings" (the plugin's `DrawMenu`, if it has one). A plugin without panels keeps the plain page.
- "Pop out" (top right of the tab) puts the panel into its own window. With the menu open the window sits above the menu and can be moved and resized; its close button and "Back to the menu" bring it back. Right-click in the window, or the tab of a popped-out panel, shows its options: **Keep open when the menu closes**, **Lock layout** (no moving or resizing), **Click-through** (with the menu closed, clicks go to the game), **Hide in photos and videos** (on by default, see `HORIZON_HOST_FLAG_CAPTURE`), **Opacity** 30-100 %.
- With the menu closed, kept windows have no title bar and can't be moved; they take mouse clicks unless they are click-through.
- `HORIZON_PANEL_HUD`: starts popped out and kept open (a timer, a split display). The player can still bring it into the menu.
- The host saves the layout per plugin id + key in `horizon\settings\host.json` (`panel.<plugin>.<key>`).
- Panels of a plugin that is off, failed or gated online are not drawn. `panel_visible(plugin, key)` says whether the body was drawn in the last frame (skip work otherwise).
- The sample plugin shows both kinds: "Events" (a tab) and "Clock" (a HUD window).

Fonts: `style()->font_*` are built once per start; still, read them from `style()` when drawing instead of keeping the pointers from Init (they are NULL until the first frame).

## Notifications and the TM Horizon bridge (ABI 1.3)

Two additions at the end of `HorizonHostApi`: `notify` (toasts) and `bridge_request` / `bridge_state` (asking the TM Horizon launcher on the same PC). Check `host->abi_minor >= 3` before using them, see "ABI versioning".

### Toasts: `notify`

A toast is a short note in the corner of the screen ("Map saved"). The host draws it in the TM Horizon look.

```c
HorizonToast t = {0};
t.size = sizeof(t);
t.kind = HORIZON_TOAST_OK;
t.title = "Map saved";            /* required, one short line */
t.text = "A01-Race";              /* optional second line, NULL or "" for none */
host->notify(host->plugin, &t);
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `size` | `sizeof(HorizonToast)`. The host ignores the call if the struct is shorter than the one it knows up to `flags`. |
| `kind` | `HORIZON_TOAST_INFO` (0), `_OK` (1), `_WARN` (2), `_ERROR` (3). Anything else counts as info. Sets the colour and the default icon. |
| `title` | Required. An empty or NULL title drops the toast. Cut at 120 characters. |
| `text` | Optional. Cut at 240 characters. |
| `icon` | An `HZ_ICON_*` codepoint, `0` = the icon of the kind. |
| `duration_ms` | `0` = 5000 ms, at most 30000 ms. Fade in and out (250 ms each) come on top. |
| `flags` | `HORIZON_TOAST_IMPORTANT` (0x01): shown even with "Do not disturb" and while driving. Use it rarely. |

Rules the host applies:

- The call is copied, can come from any thread and returns at once. Toasts of a plugin that is switched off, failed, or gated online are dropped.
- At most 3 toasts are on screen. Up to 24 wait; when more come, the oldest waiting one is dropped (it goes to the list as missed).
- "Do not disturb" (General page): no toast is shown except important ones. The others only go to the "Recent notifications" list, marked as missed.
- "Quiet while driving" (General page, on by default): while a run is going (solo or network race) toasts that are not important wait until the run ends.
- While a photo or video is being taken (`HORIZON_HOST_FLAG_CAPTURE`, `HorizonHost_SetCaptureActive`) nothing is drawn and the timers stand still.
- The last 20 toasts (shown or missed) are listed on the General page under "Recent notifications", with the plugin's name.
- Every toast is also written to the host log (`toast: title - text`).
- The notifications from TM Horizon (upload finished, mod updates, server events) use the same queue under the name "TM Horizon". See `docs/client-bridge.md`.

### The TM Horizon bridge: `bridge_request` and `bridge_state`

The game process never goes online. A plugin that needs data from the internet (a TMX search, a map file, a record replay) asks TM Horizon through the host. The protocol, the paths and the pairing are in `docs/client-bridge.md`; this section is only the plugin side.

```c
static void HORIZON_CALL onAnswer(void* user, int32_t status, const char* content_type,
                                  const void* body, uint32_t body_len) {
    if (status == 200) {
        /* body is valid only during this call: copy what you keep */
    } else if (status == HORIZON_BRIDGE_ERR_NOT_CONNECTED) {
        /* TM Horizon is not running or not paired */
    }
}

if (host->abi_minor >= 3 && host->bridge_state() == HORIZON_BRIDGE_CONNECTED) {
    HorizonResult r = host->bridge_request(host->plugin, "GET",
                          "/v1/tmx/search?game=tmnf&name=A01", NULL, 0, onAnswer, NULL);
    if (r != HORIZON_OK) { /* HORIZON_ERR_BUSY, _NOT_SUPPORTED, _INVALID_ARG */ }
}
```

`bridge_request(plugin, method, path, body, body_len, callback, user)`:

- `method` is `"GET"` or `"POST"`. `path` starts with `/v1/`, uses printable ASCII without spaces, at most 1 KB, and must not start with `/v1/client/` (those paths belong to the host: ping, pairing, events). `body` is for POST (JSON, at most 1 MB), else `NULL` and `0`.
- Return value: `HORIZON_OK` when the request is queued (or answered at once with a rate-limit error through the callback), `HORIZON_ERR_INVALID_ARG` (bad method, path or callback, or a body that is NULL with a length), `HORIZON_ERR_BUSY` (this plugin already has 8 open requests), `HORIZON_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED` (the bridge is switched off in the host), `HORIZON_ERR_WRONG_STATE` (not called on the game thread).
- The callback always comes later, on the game thread at the end of a frame, never inside `bridge_request`. Errors come the same way.
- `status` is the launcher's HTTP status (200, 404, 429 ...), or one of these:

| `status` | Constant | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| -1 | `HORIZON_BRIDGE_ERR_NOT_CONNECTED` | not paired, or TM Horizon is not running |
| -2 | `HORIZON_BRIDGE_ERR_TIMEOUT` | no answer within 45 s |
| -3 | `HORIZON_BRIDGE_ERR_RATE_LIMIT` | this plugin sent too many requests, try again later |
| -4 | `HORIZON_BRIDGE_ERR_TOO_LARGE` | the answer is larger than the host takes (16 MB) |
| -5 | `HORIZON_BRIDGE_ERR_CANCELLED` | the plugin was switched off (or gated online) before the answer came |

- `content_type` is the answer's `Content-Type` without parameters (`application/json`, `image/jpeg` ...), `""` for the negative codes. `body` and `body_len` are valid only during the call; for the negative codes they are `NULL` and `0`.
- A 401 from the launcher makes the host forget its key and pair again; the plugin sees the 401.
- A callback that crashes switches the plugin off (like any plugin callback).

`bridge_state()` returns `HORIZON_BRIDGE_OFF` (0, switched off in the host's General page, "TM Horizon connection"), `_SEARCHING` (1, TM Horizon not found yet), `_PAIRING` (2, waiting for Allow in TM Horizon), `_CONNECTED` (3) or `_DENIED` (4, the player pressed No; the host asks again after a while). It is a cheap read; call it every frame if needed. Requests sent in any other state than connected fail with `HORIZON_BRIDGE_ERR_NOT_CONNECTED`.

Limits:

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| open requests per plugin | 8 (`HORIZON_ERR_BUSY` above that) |
| request rate per plugin | 4 per second, burst 8 (above that the callback gets `HORIZON_BRIDGE_ERR_RATE_LIMIT`) |
| request body | 1 MB |
| answer | 16 MB |
| time per request | 45 s |

TM Horizon applies its own limits on top (one TMX request per second at most, caches), see `docs/client-bridge.md`.

Threading: call `bridge_request` on the game thread (`Init`, `OnEvent`, a panel's draw function, `DrawOverlay`). The host sends the request on its own thread and hands the answer back on the game thread, so the callback can touch plugin state without a lock. When a plugin is switched off, its waiting requests are dropped and the ones already answered get `HORIZON_BRIDGE_ERR_CANCELLED`. After `Shutdown` no callback arrives. If the callback's `user` pointer points to something, make sure it is still there when the answer comes (a request id looked up in a table is safer than a raw pointer).

The first plugins that use this: WR Hunter (record replay, `docs/plugins/wr-hunter.md`) and TMX Browser (`docs/plugins/tmx-browser.md`).

## For mods that are not plugins (TMVS and others)

`host.dll` (TMLoader: `HorizonHost.dll`) exports three plain C functions (`__cdecl`, stable, no ABI
struct needed). Find the module with `GetModuleHandleW(L"host.dll")` (or `L"HorizonHost.dll"`) and
`GetProcAddress`; if it is not there, Horizon is not running.

| Export | What it does |
|---|---|
| `uint32_t HorizonHost_GetUiState(void)` | What of Horizon is on screen: `1` menu open, `2` bar visible, `4` a detached panel window visible (OR-ed). `0`: nothing (also while a capture is active). |
| `void HorizonHost_SetCaptureActive(int active)` | `active != 0`: the host draws nothing (menu, bar, panels, plugin overlays) and takes no keyboard or mouse input until it is called with `0`. Last call wins (no counting per caller). Heartbeat: 10 s after the last call the capture ends by itself, so a crashed capture cannot hide Horizon for good. Only captures that read the image at Present need it: they call it with 1 every frame while they run and once with 0 afterwards. TMVS copies photos and Clips recordings at the game's frame end (before Horizon draws), so Horizon stays usable while they run; it calls this only for its fallback captures that read the image at Present (e.g. an F12 screenshot without the frame-end copy). Plugins' hotkeys keep working. |
| `uint32_t HorizonHost_Version(void)` | `(major << 16) \| (minor << 8) \| patch`, e.g. `0x000200` for 0.2.0. |

Plugins use `set_host_flag(HORIZON_HOST_FLAG_CAPTURE)` instead (ABI minor 2), which hides only the bar and the
windows with "Hide in photos and videos".

## ABI versioning

- Every struct starts with its own size (or the ABI number). The host's `HorizonHostApi.size` and `abi_minor` say how much of the table exists.
- Changes are additive only: new fields go at the end, new events get new numbers, nothing is reordered or removed.
- `HORIZON_ABI_MINOR` is 3 today: 1 = textures and `save_replay`, 2 = panels and host flags, 3 = toasts (`notify`) and the TM Horizon bridge (`bridge_request`, `bridge_state`). It counts additive changes. A plugin built against a newer minor still loads in an older host. Before using a function added later I check `host->size` (or `abi_minor`) and fall back if it is missing. For the 1.3 functions that is `host->abi_minor >= 3` (the client mods use `ck::abiAtLeast(host, 3)`, which is the same test), and then a NULL check on `host->notify` / `host->bridge_request`. A plugin that cannot work without them (TMX Browser) returns non-zero from `Init` on an older host and shows as failed. A plugin that only wants a toast (WR Hunter) skips the call.
- `HORIZON_ABI` changes only if something cannot stay compatible. The host refuses a plugin with a different `abi`.

## Building

32-bit, MSVC, static runtime, `/W4 /WX`. Plugins are built by a `build_plugin.cmd` fragment in the plugin's folder, which `build.cmd` calls with the Visual Studio x86 environment set, the working directory at the repo root, `%CXX%` set to the compile command, and `build\imgui.lib` built:

`plugins\sample` builds into `build\plugins\sample` instead of `dist`, so it never ships.

## Testing without the game

`tests\build_fake_host.cmd` builds both plugins and `build\test\fake_host.exe`, then runs them:

```
build\test\fake_host.exe <plugin dll> [--game eswc|sunrise|tmnf] [--expect-init <n>]
```

The fake host stubs the whole `HorizonHostApi`, keeps settings in memory, uses `build\test\data\<id>\` as data folder, runs a headless ImGui frame, sends a short event sequence, presses the hotkeys, toggles `SetEnabled`, calls `Shutdown` and unloads the DLL. `engine_pointer` returns NULL, so a plugin with game addresses must log and skip instead of calling game code.
